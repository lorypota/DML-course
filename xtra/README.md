# Extra
These are additional materials which are not part of the main course. They include both basic machine learning algorithms that we assume are covered in Bachelor courses, as well as more advanced algorithms that we couldn't fit into the schedule.

It also includes a series of 'studies' which are old assignments from several years ago.

However, feel free to delete this folder if you need the disk space.
